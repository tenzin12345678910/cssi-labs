<h2>JAPAN’S MASTER FIGURE SKATER</h2>
<p>Since becoming Japan’s first Olympic figure skating champion at the age of 19 at Sochi 2014, Yuzuru Hanyū has gone on to claim every world record (short, free and overall) in his event. He underlined his superiority in the men’s singles at PyeongChang 2018, where he became the first skater to retain the title since the USA’s Dick Button at Oslo 1952.</p>
<h3>LUCKY ESCAPE</h3>
<p>
  On 11 March 2011, Japanese figure skater Hanyū, who had been crowned world junior champion the previous year, was in the middle of a training session at his local ice rink when a devastating earthquake struck off the coast off his home town, Sendai, triggering a devastating tsunami.
  <br>
  The 16-year-old, ice skates still on his feet, barely had time to evacuate the building before the waves struck, and would spend the next few days in an emergency shelter with his family, surveying the damage to his home and rink from afar.
  <br>
  “I often feel that things you take for granted are not always guaranteed,” he later reflected. “Everything exists by luck. Because I almost lost everything, I came to feel this way. The disaster totally changed my values. I want to make every single day, every practice and every competition count.”
